# Next.js SSG vs SSR demo app

Welcome to the demo application for the Next.js SSG vs SSR article series from the [AntonCodes](https://antoncodes.com) blog!

## Available Scripts

Building the app:

```bash
$ npx next build
$ # or
$ npm run build
```

Starting the app (in production mode):

```bash
$ npx next start
$ # or
$ npm start
```

By default, the app will be hosted on `localhost:3000`. To host it on a different port (e.g. 8080), run:

```bash
$ npx next start -p 8080
```

Don't forget to build the app before hosting it ;)
